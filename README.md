# Repository for IDA for regression modeling 
The focus of this document/website is to provide examples on conducting initial data analysis in a reproducible manner in the context of intended regression analyses.


## Project Description

**Objective:**  Develop initial data analysis plan (IDAP) and provide sample reports for IDA before executing the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for regression modeling.

Six steps of the IDA framework [Ref 1] are

1. Meta data set-up
2. Data cleaning
3. Data screening
4. Initial data reporting
5. Updating/refining the statistical analysis plan
6. Reporting of IDA findings in research papers [Ref 2]

For our objective, we assume that meta data exist and data cleaning has already been done. We created hypothetical statistical analyses plans for each of the data sets. 
 
## Project Outcomes
 
1. Sample IDA plans and IDA reports to illustrate data screening and initial reporting (steps 3 and 4 of the IDA framework)
2. Recommendations for numerical and graphical summaries (step 3 of IDA framework) 
2. Explanation and elaboration of potential consequences to the SAP as a result of IDA findings (step 5 of IDA framework)
3. Recommendations for reporting of IDA for regression analyses (step 6 of IDA framework)
4. Manuscript with scope of regression model, generic IDA strategy, examples with IDA discoveries and consequences
 
## Installation instructions

The IDA reports are created with R, Rstudio, and Bookdown. 
Here are the requirements to preview the site locally: 

1. Get a local copy of the website source.
   
2. Start R in your new directory. 
   
3. Install the required packages. This can be achieved through the use pak or similar to install the needed packages (only the ones that you don't already have) using the [pak package](https://pak.r-lib.org/index.html).
```r
pkg_list <- c("bookdown", "devtools", "glue", "gridExtra",  "htmltools",
              "httr", "knitr", "RColorBrewer", "rebird", "rmarkdown",
              "tidyverse", "usethis", "rstudio/gt")

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install(pkg_list)
```

You should now be able to render the site in all the usual ways for bookdown, such as `bookdown::render_book()` or *Addins > Preview Book*.

Beware: the package list above is currently static, so consider that it may not be up to date.
