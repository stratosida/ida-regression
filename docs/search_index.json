We present the work flow of IDA through a series of case studies: CRASH-2 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) "],["ida-framework.html", "Chapter 1 IDA Framework", " Chapter 1 IDA Framework The IDA framework consists of six steps [Huebner et al 2018, Figure 1], here we assume that metadata (step I) exist in sufficient detail, and that data cleaning (step II) was already performed. Metadata summarize background information about the data to properly conduct IDA steps, and a data cleaning process identifies and corrects technical errors. The data screening (step III) examines data properties to inform decisions about the intended analysis. Initial data reporting (step IV) document insight of the previous steps and can be referred to when interpreting results from the regression modeling. Consequences of these analyses can be that the analysis plan needs to be refined or updated (step V). Finally, reporting of IDA results in research papers (step VI) are necessary to ensure transparency regarding key findings that influence the analysis or interpretation of results. Further details about the elements of IDA are discussed in [TG3 papers]. Figure 1.1: IDA framework References Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W .

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan, which is described in more detail in the section Crash2_SAP.Rmd. Hypothetical research aim for IDA is to develop a multivariable model for early death (death within 28 days from injury) using nine independent variables of mixed type (continuous, categorical, semicontinuous) with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome. A prediction model was developed and validated based on this data set in Predicting early death in patients with traumatic bleeding Perel et al, BMJ 2012, [supplement available at]. The assumed research aim is in line with the prediction model 4.1 CRASH-2 Description Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolyticin Significant Haemorrhage(CRASH-2) was a large randomised placebo controlled trial among trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant haemorrhage, of the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment on death and transfusion requirement. The study is described at the original trial website. A public version of the data set is found at a repository of public data sets hosted by the Vanderbilt Universitys Department of Biostatistics (Prof. Frank Harrell Jr.). The data set includes 20,207 patients and 44 variables. Note: In contrast to the analysis described in Perel et al, variables describing the economic region and the treatment allocation are missing in the public version of the data set, and while the data set contains 20,207 patients, the research paper mentions 20,127 patients having been included in the study. 4.2 Crash2 dataset contents 4.2.1 Source dataset We refer to the source data set as the dataset available online here Display the source dataset contents.

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan. Hypothetical research aim for IDA: Develop a multivariable model for early death (death within 28 days from injury) using nine independent variables of mixed type (continuous, categorical, semicontinuous) with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome. The assumed analysis aim is in line with the prediction model presented by Perel et al, BMJ 2012, supplement available at. 5.1 Outcome variable Early death, i.e. in-hospital death within 28 days from injury (binary variable) 5.2 Statistical methods Logistic regression will be used to model early death by the following independent variables (measured at randomisation) deemed important to predict early death. Demographic measurements: Age (age, years) Sex (sex, male or female) Physiological measurements: Systolic blood pressure (sbp, mmHg) Heart rate (hr, 1/min) Respiratory rate (rr, 1/min) Glasgow coma score (gcs, points) Central capillary refill time (cc, seconds) Characteristics of injury measurements: Time since injury (injurytime, hours) Type of injury (injurytype, blunt, penetrating or blunt and penetrating) Restricted cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom with knots set to default values will be used for continuous variables. As the final prediction model should be parsimonious enough to simplify its application, a backward elimination algorithm with a significance level set at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) will be applied to remove statistically insignificant effects. Finally, nonlinear representation of each continuous variable will be tested against linear representation at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). In case of lacking added value of a nonlinear effect, the model will be refitted with a linear effect for that variable. 5.3 Remarks Regarding type of injury, the original paper describes its treatment in the model as follows: Type of injury had three categories-penetrating, blunt, or blunt and penetratingbut we analysed it as penetrating or blunt and penetrating.  It is not clear from that description what happened to the blunt group. (I assume they were collapsed with blunt and penetrating.) ** we are going to consider the three categories, and then check aout recommendations for the final analysis-MH** The original paper describes the modeling approach as follows: We used a backward step-wise approach. Firstly, we included all potential prognostic factors and interaction terms that users considered plausible. These interactions included all potential predictors with type of injury, time since injury, and age. We then removed, one at a time, terms for which we found no strong evidence of an association, judged according to the P values (&lt;0.05) from the Wald test. This would mean they tested at least 24 interaction terms, each possibly using several degrees of freedom! In the final model, only an interaction of Glasgow coma score and type of injury was included. 5.4 Preparations The outcome variable, early death (i.e., death within 28 days from injury) must be computed from the time span between date of death and date of randomization using the following logic: transform ddeath and trandomisation into an interpretable date format and then compute the difference interpret missing (i.e. NAs) as not died within study period, at least not within 28 days if patients died after 28 days, treat as alive This can be derived using the following code logic: ## NOTE: This is for demonstration purposes, this code is not run here. ## The derivation was executed earlier. a_crash2$time2death &lt;- as.numeric(as.Date(a_crash2$ddeath) - as.Date(a_crash2$trandomised)) a_crash2$earlydeath[!is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;- (a_crash2$time2death[!is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;= 28) + 0 # +0 to transform it from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0 # NA in time2death means alive at day 28 a_crash2$earlydeath[is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;- 0 We also display the marginal distribution of the derived outcome variable. a_crash2 %&gt;% dplyr::select(earlydeath) %&gt;% gtsummary::tbl_summary() html { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

Hypothetical research aim for IDA is to develop a multivariable model for MVPA (minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity). MVPA can be used to examine factors distinguishing very active participants with large amounts of time spent on MVPA from others (using untransformed data) or distinguishing participants according to percentage changes in MVPA (logarithmic scale) thus de-emphasizing extreme values. 7.1 NHANES Dataset Description The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized US civilians using a multistage probability sampling design that considers geographical area and minority representation. Sample weights are generated to create nationally representative estimates for the US population and subgroups defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Link to CDC NHANES website. NHANES collects data on various health and behavior indicators, including physical activity and selfreported diagnosis of prevalent health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, stroke, and cancer. Physical activity was measured with a waistworn uniaxial accelerometer (AM7164; ActiGraph) for up to 7 days. Participants were asked to wear the devie while awake except when simming or bathing. Data were cleaned according to calibration specification and nonwear time defined by an interval of at least 60 consecutive minutes of zero activity intensity counts. Days with fewer than 10 hours of wear time were excluded and participants with at least 1 valid day of accelerometer data were included in the analysis. Mean counts per minute were calculated by dividing the sum of activity counts for a valid day by the number of minutes of wear time in that day across all valid days (Troiano 2008). Moderate or vigorous intensity was based on count thresholds. Time spent in such activities was determined by summing minutes in a day where the count met the criterion for that intensity (Troiano 2008). The NHANES 20032004 and 20052006 have a total of 14,631 participants with accelerometry data. Participants aged 30 to 85 at the time they wore the accelerometer are included. Other inclusion criteria are in line with the choices for the prediction model of 5 year mortality presented by Smirnova et al, J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2020. The preparation of the data was based on Organizing and Analyzing the Activity Data in NHANES Leroux et al, Statistics in Biosciences 2019. High quality processed activity data combined with mortality and demographic information can be downloaded and used in R with code from Andrew Leroux (https://andrew-leroux.github.io/rnhanesdata/articles). 7.1.1 Variables 7.1.1.1 Outcome variable MVPA (total minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity which is defined as more than 2020 counts per minute) (mvpa, minutes) 7.1.1.2 Sociodemographic variables age at examination (i.e. when participants wore the device) (age, years) gender (gender, Male and Female) race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and Other) education (Less than high school, High school (high school graduate/general educational development [GED]), More than high school (some college, and college graduate)) (educationadult) Person Months of Follow-up from MEC/Exam Date (permth.exm) (follow-up time in this cohort in years = permth.exm/12) 7.1.1.3 Health and behavior variables smoking status (Current, Former [those reporting quitting within the previous 6 months], and Never) (smokecigs) alcohol consumption (drinkstatus) (Non-Drinker, Moderate Drinker, Heavy Drinker, Missing alcohol) bmi (bmi, kg/m2) obesity (bmi.cat, No-Yes) diabetes (diabetes) congestive heart failure (chf, No-Yes) cancer (cancer, No-Yes) stroke (stroke, No-Yes) average systolic blood pressure using the 4 measurements per participant (sys, mmHg) Total cholesterol (lbxtc, mg/dL) HDL cholesterol (lbdhdd, mg/dL) 7.1.1.4 Physical activity data Summary measures are calculated due to the large size of minute level accelerometer-derived physical activity data. total activity counts per day (TAC/d) total log activity count (TLAC log(1+TAC)) total minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) total accelerometer wear time (WT) total log activity count summary measures (tlac.1, tlac.2, , tlac.12) in each 2-hr window, i.e. 12AM-2AM, 2AM-4AM, 4AM-6AM, etc. 7.2 NHANES dataset contents 7.2.1 Source dataset We refer to the source data set as the dataset available online here 7.2.2 Data dictionary Additional meta-data is added to the original source data set.

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan. IDA follows the generic IDA plan developed in this project and is adapted to the data set given the hypothetical research aim. 8.1 Initial data analysis strategy 1. Statistical analysis plan: as assumed above, the analysis strategy to answer the main research question has been prespecified. It comprises of the set of independent variables to be considered in a model, the outcome variable, and the analytical strategy to build the regression model. The aim is to develop develop a multivariable model for MVPA (minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity).The continuous outcome variable MVPA will be predicted with linear regression models from explanatory variables age, gender, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, comorbidities (cancer, CHF, stroke). Partial R-squared will be used to identify an appropriate set of variables to predict MVPA. 2. Data dictionary and metadata: a detailed data dictionary should be available which informs about the meaning of each variable in context of the research question, the units of measurement, the possible levels in case of categorical variables, or admissible values. More generally, metadata, also refer to information about the research study protocol and data collection processes. A data dictionary was included in the previous section. 3. Domain expertise and pivotal covariates (very important predictors, VIPs) 3.1. In particular for analyses with a moderate to high number of covariates, domain expertise should guide assumptions which covariates are considered to be strongly related with the outcome and hence are very important predictors in the regression model, and which variables have a weak or unknown association with the outcome (cf. Heinze et al, Biometrical Journal 2018). Depending on context and assumptions on strength of association with the outcome variable, two to three pivotal covariates should be defined (e.g., age and gender). Pivotal covariates: It has been shown that physical activity declines with age and men report higher levels of activity than women. Keadle S et al. Prevalence and trends in physical activity among older adults in the United States: A comparison across three national surveys. Prev Med. 2016 Aug; 89: 3743. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.05.009 Clarke TC, Norris T, and Schiller JS. Early Release of Selected Estimates Based on Data From the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/releases/released201905.htm#7a 3.2. Domain expertise may also be useful to specify in advance which variables are expected to correlate with each other. This background knowledge could be summarized in a directed or undirected acyclic graph connecting the covariates with each other as also suggested by Heinze et al, 2018. We define groups of variables: socio-demographic variables, health and behavior variables, and physical activity data. 3.3. Missing value mechanisms: if not already specified in meta data, domain experts should also be consulted to explain possible reasons for the occurrence of missing values for each variable, which may be categorized as systematic or unsystematic. Missing values are expected due to the nature of survey research. Domain expertise would be helpful in identifying specific expectations. This will be considered in the IDA domain Missing values to identify approaches or updates to the statistical analysis plan. 8.1.1 IDA domain: missing values 1. Number and proportion of missing values for each independent variable, for the dependent variable and for the analysis as a whole. Number and proportion of missing values will be computed for all variables and groups of variables (demographics, lifestyle, health). 2. Patterns of missing values across all independent variables, either as tables or appropriately visualized. We will create missing value indicators for each covariate and will then visualize patterns. 8.1.2 IDA domain: univariate distributions 3. For categorical variables (including the dependent variable): frequency and proportion for each category. Demographic variables, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, and mortality status will be described by frequencies and proportions. 4. For continuous variables (including the dependent variable): high-resolution histogram, summary of main percentiles (1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th) and interquartile range, 5 highest and 5 lowest values, first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, number of distinct values. Summaries for all continuous variables (age, BMI, physiological variables, physical activity) will be created to depict their marginal distributions by means of high-resolution histograms. Furthermore, each continuous variable will be described by 1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th percentiles, interquartile range, the 5 highest and 5 lowest values, the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, and the number of distinct values. While the outcome variable MVPA is the only physical activity variable in the analysis plan, since it is a derived variables from some of the other physical activity variables, others will be looked at in the univariate step to identify potential issues of skewness or unusual values. The graphical summary for each variable will serve to suggest transformations for each variable: no transformation (in case of approximate symmetry); \\(\\log_{10}(x+1)\\) transformation (in case of skewness) The distributions of transformed variables will be evaluated as well as described above. It is assumed that the data have been cleaned, but unusual values will be identified and possibly excluded. 8.1.3 IDA domain: multivariate system of variables 5. Matrix/heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients between all independent variables. Pearson correlation coefficients will be computed between all independent variables. The correlation coefficients will be depicted by means of a heat map. Differences between Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients will be graphically investigated. 6. Appropriate visual (and numerical) presentations of the association of each covariate with the two pivotal covariates. A redundancy analysis will be conducted for each variable. This analysis identifies predictors that can be almost perfectly predicted by flexible parametric additive models performed on the companion covariates. Categorical and continuous variables will be summarized with counts and proportions or medians and quartiles, as appropriate, in a table stratified by sex and age groups. Scatterplots of continuous variables by age will be constructed stratified by gender. 7. If interactions between covariates were prespecified to be included in the regression model, special attention should be given to evaluate the bivariate distribution of the interacting covariates. Appropriate graphical displays (see 6) should be used to visualise these distributions. Interactions between age and gender will be considered. The distribution of age will be depicted as histogram stratified for gender. 8. For a derived outcome variable, the bivariate distribution of these variables with the outcome variable should be evaluated with appropriate visualizations.. Scatter plots of the physical activity variables with MVPA will be constructed with trend lines. "]]
