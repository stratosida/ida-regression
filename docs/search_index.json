"],["ida-framework.html", "Chapter 1 IDA Framework", " Chapter 1 IDA Framework The IDA framework consists of six steps [Huebner et al 2018, Figure 1], here we assume that metadata (step I) exist in sufficient detail, and that data cleaning (step II) was already performed. Metadata summarize background information about the data to properly conduct IDA steps, and a data cleaning process identifies and corrects technical errors. The data screening (step III) examines data properties to inform decisions about the intended analysis. Initial data reporting (step IV) document insight of the previous steps and can be referred to when interpreting results from the regression modeling. Consequences of these analyses can be that the analysis plan needs to be refined or updated (step V). Finally, reporting of IDA results in research papers (step VI) are necessary to ensure transparency regarding key findings that influence the analysis or interpretation of results. Further details about the elements of IDA are discussed in [TG3 papers]. Figure 1.1: IDA framework References Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W .

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan, which is described in more detail in the section Crash2_SAP.Rmd. Hypothetical research aim for IDA is to develop a multivariable model for early death (death within 28 days from injury) using nine independent variables of mixed type (continuous, categorical, semicontinuous) with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome. A prediction model was developed and validated based on this data set in Predicting early death in patients with traumatic bleeding Perel et al, BMJ 2012, [supplement available at]. The assumed research aim is in line with the prediction model 4.1 CRASH-2 Description Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolyticin Significant Haemorrhage(CRASH-2) was a large randomised placebo controlled trial among trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant haemorrhage, of the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment on death and transfusion requirement. The study is described at the original trial website. A public version of the data set is found at a repository of public data sets hosted by the Vanderbilt Universitys Department of Biostatistics (Prof. Frank Harrell Jr.). The data set includes 20,207 patients and 44 variables. Note: In contrast to the analysis described in Perel et al, variables describing the economic region and the treatment allocation are missing in the public version of the data set, and while the data set contains 20,207 patients, the research paper mentions 20,127 patients having been included in the study. 4.2 Crash2 dataset contents 4.2.1 Source dataset We refer to the source data set as the dataset available online here Display the source dataset contents.

Hypothetical research aim for IDA: Develop a multivariable model for early death (death within 28 days from injury) using nine independent variables of mixed type (continuous, categorical, semicontinuous) with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome. The assumed analysis aim is in line with the prediction model presented by Perel et al, BMJ 2012, supplement available at. 5.1 Outcome variable Early death, i.e. in-hospital death within 28 days from injury (binary variable) 5.2 Statistical methods Logistic regression will be used to model early death by the following independent variables (measured at randomisation) deemed important to predict early death. Demographic measurements: Age (age, years) Sex (sex, male or female) Physiological measurements: Systolic blood pressure (sbp, mmHg) Heart rate (hr, 1/min) Respiratory rate (rr, 1/min) Glasgow coma score (gcs, points) Central capillary refill time (cc, seconds) Characteristics of injury measurements: Time since injury (injurytime, hours) Type of injury (injurytype, blunt, penetrating or blunt and penetrating) Restricted cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom with knots set to default values will be used for continuous variables. As the final prediction model should be parsimonious enough to simplify its application, a backward elimination algorithm with a significance level set at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) will be applied to remove statistically insignificant effects. Finally, nonlinear representation of each continuous variable will be tested against linear representation at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). In case of lacking added value of a nonlinear effect, the model will be refitted with a linear effect for that variable. 5.3 Remarks Regarding type of injury, the original paper describes its treatment in the model as follows: Type of injury had three categories-penetrating, blunt, or blunt and penetratingbut we analysed it as penetrating or blunt and penetrating.  It is not clear from that description what happened to the blunt group. (I assume they were collapsed with blunt and penetrating.) ** we are going to consider the three categories, and then check aout recommendations for the final analysis-MH** The original paper describes the modeling approach as follows: We used a backward step-wise approach. Firstly, we included all potential prognostic factors and interaction terms that users considered plausible. These interactions included all potential predictors with type of injury, time since injury, and age. We then removed, one at a time, terms for which we found no strong evidence of an association, judged according to the P values (&lt;0.05) from the Wald test. This would mean they tested at least 24 interaction terms, each possibly using several degrees of freedom! In the final model, only an interaction of Glasgow coma score and type of injury was included. 5.4 Preparations The outcome variable, early death (i.e., death within 28 days from injury) must be computed from the time span between date of death and date of randomization using the following logic: transform ddeath and trandomisation into an interpretable date format and then compute the difference interpret missing (i.e. NAs) as not died within study period, at least not within 28 days if patients died after 28 days, treat as alive This can be derived using the following code logic: ## NOTE: This is for demostration purposes, this code is not run here. ## The derivation was executed earlier. a_crash2$time2death &lt;- as.numeric(as.Date(a_crash2$ddeath) - as.Date(a_crash2$trandomised)) a_crash2$earlydeath[!is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;- (a_crash2$time2death[!is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;= 28) + 0 # +0 to transform it from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0 # NA in time2death means alive at day 28 a_crash2$earlydeath[is.na(a_crash2$time2death)] &lt;- 0 We also display the marginal distribution of the derived outcome variable. a_crash2 %&gt;% dplyr::select(earlydeath) %&gt;% gtsummary::tbl_summary() html { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

Hypothetical research aim for IDA is to develop a multivariable model for MVPA (minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity). MVPA can be used to examine factors distinguishing very active participants with large amounts of time spent on MVPA from others (using untransformed data) or distinguishing participants according to percentage changes in MVPA (logarithmic scale) thus de-emphasizing extreme values. 9.1 NHANES Dataset Description The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized US civilians using a multistage probability sampling design that considers geographical area and minority representation. Sample weights are generated to create nationally representative estimates for the US population and subgroups defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Link to CDC NHANES website. NHANES collects data on various health and behavior indicators, including physical activity and selfreported diagnosis of prevalent health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, stroke, and cancer. Physical activity was measured with a waistworn uniaxial accelerometer (AM7164; ActiGraph) for up to 7 days. Participants were asked to wear the devie while awake except when simming or bathing. Data were cleaned according to calibration specification and nonwear time defined by an interval of at least 60 consecutive minutes of zero activity intensity counts. Days with fewer than 10 hours of wear time were excluded and participants with at least 1 valid day of accelerometer data were included in the analysis. Mean counts per minute were calculated by dividing the sum of activity counts for a valid day by the number of minutes of wear time in that day across all valid days (Troiano 2008). Moderate or vigorous intensity was based on count thresholds. Time spent in such activities was determined by summing minutes in a day where the count met the criterion for that intensity (Troiano 2008). The NHANES 20032004 and 20052006 have a total of 14,631 participants with accelerometry data. Participants aged 30 to 85 at the time they wore the accelerometer are included. Other inclusion criteria are in line with the choices for the prediction model of 5 year mortality presented by Smirnova et al, J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2020. The preparation of the data was based on Organizing and Analyzing the Activity Data in NHANES Leroux et al, Statistics in Biosciences 2019.

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan. IDA follows the generic IDA plan developed in this project and is adapted to the data set given the hypothetical research aim. 10.1 Initial data analysis strategy 1. Statistical analysis plan: as assumed above, the analysis strategy to answer the main research question has been prespecified. It comprises of the set of independent variables to be considered in a model, the outcome variable, and the analytical strategy to build the regression model. The aim is to develop develop a multivariable model for MVPA (minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity).The continuous outcome variable MVPA will be predicted with linear regression models from explanatory variables age, gender, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, comorbidities (cancer, CHF, stroke). Partial R-squared will be used to identify an appropriate set of variables to predict MVPA. 2. Data dictionary and metadata: a detailed data dictionary should be available which informs about the meaning of each variable in context of the research question, the units of measurement, the possible levels in case of categorical variables, or admissible values. More generally, metadata, also refer to information about the research study protocol and data collection processes. A data dictionary was included in the previous section. 3. Domain expertise and pivotal covariates (very important predictors, VIPs) 3.1. In particular for analyses with a moderate to high number of covariates, domain expertise should guide assumptions which covariates are considered to be 'strongly related' with the outcome and hence are very important predictors in the regression model, and which variables have a weak or unknown association with the outcome (cf. Heinze et al, Biometrical Journal 2018). Depending on context and assumptions on strength of association with the outcome variable, two to three pivotal covariates should be defined (e.g., age and gender). Pivotal covariates: It has been shown that physical activity declines with age and men report higher levels of activity than women. Keadle S et al. Prevalence and trends in physical activity among older adults in the United States: A comparison across three national surveys. Prev Med. 2016 Aug; 89: 3743. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.05.009 Clarke TC, Norris T, and Schiller JS. Early Release of Selected Estimates Based on Data From the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/releases/released201905.htm#7a 3.2. Domain expertise may also be useful to specify in advance which variables are expected to correlate with each other. This background knowledge could be summarized in a directed or undirected acyclic graph connecting the covariates with each other as also suggested by Heinze et al, 2018. We define groups of variables: socio-demographic variables, health and behavior variables, and physical activity data. 3.3. Missing value mechanisms: if not already specified in meta data, domain experts should also be consulted to explain possible reasons for the occurrence of missing values for each variable, which may be categorized as systematic or unsystematic. Missing values are expected due to the nature of survey research. Domain expertise would be helpful in identifying specific expectations. This will be considered in the IDA domain Missing values to identify approaches or updates to the statistical analysis plan. 10.1.1 IDA domain: missing values 1. Number and proportion of missing values for each independent variable, for the dependent variable and for the analysis as a whole. Number and proportion of missing values will be computed for all variables and groups of variables (demographics, lifestyle, health). 2. Patterns of missing values across all independent variables, either as tables or appropriately visualized. We will create missing value indicators for each covariate and will then visualize patterns. 10.1.2 IDA domain: univariate distributions 3. For categorical variables (including the dependent variable): frequency and proportion for each category. Demographic variables, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, and mortality status will be described by frequencies and proportions. 4. For continuous variables (including the dependent variable): high-resolution histogram, summary of main percentiles (1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th) and interquartile range, 5 highest and 5 lowest values, first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, number of distinct values. Summaries for all continuous variables (age, BMI, physiological variables, physical activity) will be created to depict their marginal distributions by means of high-resolution histograms. Furthermore, each continuous variable will be described by 1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th percentiles, interquartile range, the 5 highest and 5 lowest values, the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, and the number of distinct values. While the outcome variable MVPA is the only physical activity variable in the analysis plan, since it is a derived variables from some of the other physical activity variables, others will be looked at in the univariate step to identify potential issues of skewness or unusual values. The graphical summary for each variable will serve to suggest transformations for each variable: no transformation (in case of approximate symmetry); \\(\\log_{10}(x+1)\\) transformation (in case of skewness) The distributions of transformed variables will be evaluated as well as described above. It is assumed that the data have been cleaned, but unusual values will be identified and possibly excluded. 10.1.3 IDA domain: multivariate system of variables 5. Matrix/heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients between all independent variables. Pearson correlation coefficients will be computed between all independent variables. The correlation coefficients will be depicted by means of a heat map. Differences between Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients will be graphically investigated. 6. Appropriate visual (and numerical) presentations of the association of each covariate with the two pivotal covariates. A redundancy analysis will be conducted for each variable. This analysis identifies predictors that can be almost perfectly predicted by flexible parametric additive models performed on the companion covariates. Categorical and continuous variables will be summarized with counts and proportions or medians and quartiles, as appropriate, in a table stratified by sex and age groups. Scatterplots of continuous variables by age will be constructed stratified by gender. 7. If interactions between covariates were prespecified to be included in the regression model, special attention should be given to evaluate the bivariate distribution of the interacting covariates. Appropriate graphical displays (see 6) should be used to visualise these distributions. Interactions between age and gender will be considered. The distribution of age will be depicted as histogram stratified for gender. 8. For a derived outcome variable, the bivariate distribution of these variables with the outcome variable should be evaluated with appropriate visualizations.. Scatter plots of the physical activity variables with MVPA will be constructed with trend lines.

There are 7 independent variables with missing values in the dataset. Physiological variables (blood pressure, cholesterol) have the highest proportion of missingness. There does not seem to be a pattern of missingness across variables, other than the cholesterol (toal, HDL) variables. In addition, we can explore missing data mechanisms and relationships between BMI and systolic blood pressure, included in the same scatterplot: Missing values are seen across the same range of values for the other variable. There is an extreme value in BMI for males that is likely an entry error. 11.4 (In)complete cases This section presents patients with a least one missing value. First we list out patients with at least one missing value in a filterable table. Then we report the pattern of missing for this set of patients. 11.5 Section session info ## R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 17763) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Austria.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Austria.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Austria.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Austria.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] grid stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods ## [8] base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] VIM_6.1.1 colorspace_2.0-3 arsenal_3.6.3 DT_0.22 ## [5] kableExtra_1.3.4 gt_0.4.0 naniar_0.6.1 Hmisc_4.6-0 ## [9] Formula_1.2-4 survival_3.2-13 lattice_0.20-45 forcats_0.5.1 ## [13] stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.8 purrr_0.3.4 readr_2.1.2 ## [17] tidyr_1.2.0 tibble_3.1.6 ggplot2_3.3.5 tidyverse_1.3.1 ## [21] here_1.0.1 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] ellipsis_0.3.2 class_7.3-20 visdat_0.5.3 ## [4] rprojroot_2.0.2 htmlTable_2.4.0 base64enc_0.1-3 ## [7] fs_1.5.2 rstudioapi_0.13 proxy_0.4-26 ## [10] farver_2.1.0 fansi_1.0.3 lubridate_1.8.0 ## [13] ranger_0.13.1 xml2_1.3.3 splines_4.1.3 ## [16] robustbase_0.95-0 knitr_1.38 jsonlite_1.8.0 ## [19] broom_0.7.12 cluster_2.1.2 dbplyr_2.1.1 ## [22] png_0.1-7 compiler_4.1.3 httr_1.4.2 ## [25] backports_1.4.1 assertthat_0.2.1 Matrix_1.4-0 ## [28] fastmap_1.1.0 cli_3.2.0 htmltools_0.5.2 ## [31] tools_4.1.3 gtable_0.3.0 glue_1.6.2 ## [34] Rcpp_1.0.8.3 carData_3.0-5 cellranger_1.1.0 ## [37] jquerylib_0.1.4 vctrs_0.3.8 svglite_2.1.0 ## [40] crosstalk_1.2.0 lmtest_0.9-40 xfun_0.30 ## [43] laeken_0.5.2 rvest_1.0.2 lifecycle_1.0.1 ## [46] DEoptimR_1.0-11 zoo_1.8-9 MASS_7.3-55 ## [49] scales_1.1.1 hms_1.1.1 RColorBrewer_1.1-2 ## [52] yaml_2.3.5 gridExtra_2.3 UpSetR_1.4.0 ## [55] sass_0.4.1 rpart_4.1.16 latticeExtra_0.6-29 ## [58] stringi_1.7.6 highr_0.9 e1071_1.7-9 ## [61] checkmate_2.0.0 boot_1.3-28 commonmark_1.8.0 ## [64] rlang_1.0.2 pkgconfig_2.0.3 systemfonts_1.0.4 ## [67] evaluate_0.15 labeling_0.4.2 htmlwidgets_1.5.4 ## [70] tidyselect_1.1.2 plyr_1.8.7 magrittr_2.0.2 ## [73] bookdown_0.25 R6_2.5.1 generics_0.1.2 ## [76] DBI_1.1.2 pillar_1.7.0 haven_2.4.3 ## [79] foreign_0.8-82 withr_2.5.0 abind_1.4-5 ## [82] sp_1.4-6 nnet_7.3-17 modelr_0.1.8 ## [85] crayon_1.5.1 car_3.0-12 utf8_1.2.2 ## [88] tzdb_0.2.0 rmarkdown_2.13 jpeg_0.1-9 ## [91] readxl_1.3.1 data.table_1.14.2 vcd_1.4-9 ## [94] reprex_2.0.1 digest_0.6.29 webshot_0.5.2 ## [97] munsell_0.5.0 viridisLite_0.4.0 bslib_0.3.1 "],["univariate-distribution-checks-1.html", "Chapter 12 Univariate distribution checks 12.1 Data set overview 12.2 Categorical variables 12.3 Continuous variables 12.4 Section session info", " Chapter 12 Univariate distribution checks This section reports a series of univariate summary checks of the NHANES dataset. 12.1 Data set overview Using the Hmisc describe function, we provide an overview of the data set.

Hypothetical research aim for IDA is to develop a multivariable diagnostic model for bacteremia using 49 continuous laboratory blood parameters, age and gender with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome (explaining the multivariable model). A diagnostic prediction model was developed based on this data set and validated in A Risk Prediction Model for Screening Bacteremic Patients: A Cross Sectional Study Ratzinger et al, PLoS One 2014. The assumed research aim is in line with this diagnostic prediction model. 14.1 Dataset Description Ratzinger et al (2014) performed a diagnostic study in which age, sex and 49 laboratory variables can be used to diagnose bacteremia status of a blood sample using a multivariable model. Between January 2006 and December 2010, patients with the clinical suspicion to suffer from bacteraemia were included if blood culture analysis was requested by the responsible physician and blood was sampled for assessment of haematology and biochemistry. The data consists of 14,691 observations from different patients. Our version of this data was slightly modified compared to original version, and this modified version was cleared by the Medical University of Vienna for public use (DC 2019-0054). Variable names have been kept as they were (partly German abbreviations). A data dictionary is available in the misc folder of the project directory (bacteremia-DataDictionary.csv). In the original paper describing the study (Ratzinger et al, PLoS One 2014), a machine learning approach was taken to diagnose a positive status of blood culture. The true status was determined for all blood samples by blood culture analysis, which is the gold standard. Here we will make use of a multivariable logistic regression model. 14.2 Bacteremia dataset contents 14.2.1 Source dataset We refer to the source data set as the dataset available in this repository.

IDA may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan. To demonstrate the workflow and content of IDA, we created a hypothetical research aim and corresponding statistical analysis plan. IDA follows the generic IDA plan developed in this project and is adapted to the data set given the hypothetical research aim. 15.1 Preparations 1. Statistical analysis plan: as assumed above, the analysis strategy to answer the main research question has been prespecified. It comprises of the set of independent variables to be considered in a model, the outcome variable, and the analytical strategy to build the regression model. The aim of the analysis is to derive a parsimonious model to predict bacteremia status from age, gender, and 49 continuous laboratory variables. Logistic regression with consideration of nonlinear effects by fractional polynomials will be considered. The multivariable fractional polynomial algorithm will be employed considering first-order fractional polynomials for the continuous covariates. In a first step, optimal transformations for each covariate will be determined without variable selection. In the second step, we will apply the garrote to assign nonnegative shrinkage factors to the coefficients. The shrinkage factors will be determined by optimizing AIC in the second step. It is considered to impute missing values using multiple imputation with chained equations, and to generate a stacked data set for analysis. The number of imputations will be determined after initial data analysis. To assess internal performance of the diagnostic model, we will consider 10-fold cross-validation (CV), repeating the above-described model building steps. The folds will be built by dividing the patient cohort into 10 approximately equally-sized groups. All imputed observations of a patient will be assigned to the same fold. From the 10-fold CV, the area under the ROC, the calibration in the large and the calibration slope will be estimated and reported. The final regression model will be derived from analysing the full cohort with that strategy. 2. Data dictionary and metadata: a detailed data dictionary should be available which informs about the meaning of each variable in context of the research question, the units of measurement, the possible levels in case of categorical variables, or admissible values. More generally, metadata, also refer to information about the research study protocol and data collection processes. A data dictionary is available. 3. Domain expertise and pivotal covariates (very important predictors, VIPs) 3.1. In particular for analyses with a moderate to high number of covariates, domain expertise should guide assumptions which covariates are considered to be 'strongly related' with the outcome and hence are very important predictors in the regression model, and which variables have a weak or unknown association with the outcome (cf. Heinze et al, Biometrical Journal 2018). Depending on context and assumptions on strength of association with the outcome variable, two to three pivotal covariates should be defined (e.g., age and sex). Pivotal covariates: Ratzinger et al (2014) cite 5 papers who have proposed a prediction model for bacteremia before. From these papers, the following knowledge could be extracted: Covariates with assumed strong association with bacteremia: Jaimes (2004): age heart rate temperature leukocyte count use of central venous catheter length of hospitalization Bates 1997 Suspected or documented focal infection at onset antibiotics before onset any liver disease Hickman catheter present altered mental status within 24h focal abdominal signs withing 24h Lee (2012) age presence of rigor presence of chills body temperature blood urea nitrogen blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio thrombocytopenia Tudela (2010) Charlson index PCT Kuppermann (1998) age temperature clinical score WBC count absolute neutrophil count absolute band count It has to be admitted that some of these selections are based on inappropriate methods, e.g., use of univariate logistic regression screening, or were derived for special settings or cohorts, e.g. use in emergency room, or use in children. Out of the set of variables used in the models of the cited 5 papers, the following six variables also available in our data set and are considered as very important predictors (VIPs): age (mentioned in 3 papers) leukocytes (WBC) (2) blood urea neutrogen (BUN) (1) creatinine (KREA) (1) thrombocytes (PLT) (1) neutrophiles (NEU) (1) Based on this review, we consider age and leukocytes (WBC) as pivotal covariates for the research question. 3.2. Domain expertise may also be useful to specify in advance which variables are expected to correlate with each other. This background knowledge could be summarized in a directed or undirected acyclic graph connecting the covariates with each other as also suggested by Heinze et al, 2018. Important variable groups for modeling may be from the group of leukocytes, kidney function related parameters and parameters indicating a reaction to an acute phase. Leukocytes The following systematic dependencies between variables exist: WBC \\(\\approx\\) BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO In some patients, this relation may only approximately apply because they are in an acute infection phase. Moreover, the following variables are percentages and hence sum up to 100: BASOR = BASO / (BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO) * 100 EOSR = EOS / (BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO) * 100 NEUR = NEU / (BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO) * 100 MONOR = MONO / (BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO) * 100 LYMR = LYM / (BASO + EOS + NEU + LYM + MONO) * 100 BASOR + EOSR + NEU + MONOR + LYMR = 100 Therefore, at least one of these five variables is redundant. Acute phase reaction An acute phase reaction may be indicated by FIB, CRP, and the liver parameters ASAT, ALAT and GGT; hence some correlation between these variables is expected. Kidney function indicators Potassium level (K), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr, KREA) are variables that are related to kidney function. Kidney function is usually expressed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Using the CKD-EPI-formula, eGFR can be computed as follows, with sex-specific constants \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa) and \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha): \\(eGFR = 141 \\times min(Scr/\\kappa, 1)^\\alpha \\times max(Scr/\\kappa, 1)^{-1.209} \\times 0.993^{age}\\) where for males \\(\\kappa = 0.9, \\alpha = -0.411\\), and for females \\(\\kappa = 0.7, \\alpha = -0.329\\). kappa &lt;- rep(0.7, nrow(a_bact)) kappa[a_bact$sex==1] &lt;- 0.9 alpha &lt;- rep(-0.329, nrow(a_bact)) alpha[a_bact$sex==1] &lt;- -0.411 a_bact$eGFR &lt;- 141 * apply(cbind(a_bact$KREA/kappa, 1),1,min)**alpha * apply(cbind(a_bact$KREA/kappa, 1),1,max)**(-1.209) * 0.993**a_bact$Alter * 1.018**(a_bact$sex==2) a_bact$BUN_KREA &lt;- a_bact$BUN / a_bact$KREA b_bact &lt;- Hmisc::upData(a_bact , labels = c(eGFR = &#39;estimated glomerular filtration rate&#39;, BUN_KREA = &#39;BUN/Scr ratio&#39;), units = c(eGFR = &#39;mL/min/1.73 m^2&#39;, BUN_KREA = &#39;unitless&#39;)) ## Input object size: 5456368 bytes; 56 variables 14691 observations ## New object size: 5456400 bytes; 56 variables 14691 observations Some correlation between these kidney function indicators (eGFR, potassium, BUN) can be expected. eGFR is a widely accepted and interpretable summary of kidney function. BUN should be in the range 6-20 (8-23 for adults older than 60 years). An ideal ratio of BUN to Scr is between 10 and 20. Ratios higher than 20 may be associated with high protein diet but also with impaired eGFR (lower than 60). We define groups of variables: demographical, pivotal, leukocyte-related, leukocyte-ratio-related, kidney-related, acute-phase related: demog_vars &lt;-c(&quot;Alter&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;) pivotal_vars &lt;- c(&quot;WBC&quot;, &quot;Alter&quot;) vip_vars &lt;- c(&quot;WBC&quot;, &quot;Alter&quot;, &quot;BUN&quot;,&quot;KREA&quot;,&quot;NEU&quot;,&quot;PLT&quot;) leuko_related_vars &lt;-c(&quot;WBC&quot;, &quot;NEU&quot;, &quot;EOS&quot;, &quot;BASO&quot;, &quot;LYM&quot;, &quot;MONO&quot;) leuko_ratio_vars &lt;- c(&quot;NEUR&quot;, &quot;EOSR&quot;, &quot;BASOR&quot;, &quot;LYMR&quot;, &quot;MONOR&quot;) kidney_related_vars &lt;- c(&quot;BUN&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;KREA&quot;, &quot;eGFR&quot;, &quot;BUN_KREA&quot;) acute_related_vars &lt;- c(&quot;FIB&quot;, &quot;CRP&quot;, &quot;ASAT&quot;, &quot;ALAT&quot;, &quot;GGT&quot;) outcome_vars &lt;-c(&quot;BloodCulture&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;) remaining_vars &lt;- names(a_bact)[is.na(match(names(a_bact),c(&quot;ID&quot;, demog_vars, pivotal_vars, vip_vars,leuko_related_vars,leuko_ratio_vars, kidney_related_vars,acute_related_vars, outcome_vars)))] bact_variables &lt;- list(demog_vars=demog_vars, pivotal_vars=pivotal_vars, vip_vars=vip_vars, leuko_related_vars=leuko_related_vars, leuko_ratio_vars=leuko_ratio_vars, kidney_related_vars=kidney_related_vars, acute_related_vars=acute_related_vars, remaining_vars=remaining_vars, outcome_vars=outcome_vars) 3.3. Missing value mechanisms: if not already specified in meta data, domain experts should also be consulted to explain possible reasons for the occurrence of missing values for each variable, which may be categorized as systematic or unsystematic. A certain proportion of missing values is expected because of the lab test request which is often specific to the underlying condition. No specific expectations can be made. 15.2 IDA domains 15.2.1 IDA domain: missing values 1. Number and proportion of missing values for each independent variable, for the dependent variable and for the analysis as a whole. Number and proportion of missing values will be computed for age, sex, the 49 laboratory variables, BloodCulture, as well as for the analysis as a whole. 2. Patterns of missing values across all independent variables, either as tables or appropriately visualized. We will create missing value indicators for each covariate and will then summarize patterns by means of a heat map and a dendogram. 15.2.2 IDA domain: univariate distributions 3. For categorical variables (including the dependent variable): frequency and proportion for each category. Sex and BloodCulture will be described by frequencies and proportions. 4. For continuous variables (including the dependent variable): high-resolution histogram, summary of main percentiles (1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th) and interquartile range, 5 highest and 5 lowest values, first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, number of distinct values. Summaries for all 50 continuous variables (age and 49 laboratory variables) will be created to depict their marginal distributions by means of high-resolution histograms. Furthermore, each continuous variable will be described by 1st, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 99th percentiles, interquartile range, the 5 highest and 5 lowest values, the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, curtosis), standard deviation, and the number of distinct values. The graphical summary for each variable will serve to suggest transformations for each variable: no transformation (in case of approximate symmetry); \\(\\log_{10}(x+c)\\) or \\(\\log_2(x+c)\\) transformation (in case of skewness), determination of the safety constant \\(c\\) as the value that optimizes correlation with standard normal scores. The distributions of transformed variables will be evaluated in the same way as the original variables as described above. 15.2.3 IDA domain: multivariate system of variables 5. Matrix/heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients between all independent variables. Using the suggested transformations for each variable, Pearson correlation coefficients will be computed between all independent variables. The correlation coefficients will be depicted by means of a (quadratic) heat map. Moreover, a network graph between all independent variables will be constructed, which will be thresholded at an absolute correlation coefficient of 0.3. Spearman correlation coefficients will be computed as well, and the 10 pairs of covariates with the largest absolute difference between Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients will be flagged. These pairs will be graphically investigated by constructing separate scatterplots. 6. Appropriate visual presentation of the association of each covariate with the two pivotal covariates. Also for this analysis, transformations of covariates will be used as identified in step 4. First, the distribution of age will be depicted as histogram stratified for sex. Second, a scatterplot of leukocytes by age will be constructed, using different colours for the two sexes. Third, age will be categorized into three groups: \\(\\geq\\) 65 years, 50-65 years, \\(&lt;\\) 50 years. Should this lead to a very imbalanced distribution of patients (the largest group containing more than four times as many patients as the smallest group), groups will be defined based on 25th and 75th percentiles. Each lab variable (or its transformation) will then be depicted in a scatterplot with leukocytes (or its transformation) in each of the three age groups, marking the dots with two different colours representing sex. Fourth, a heat map of the raw data (or transformations) will be constructed. Fifth, a redundancy analysis will be conducted for each variable. This analysis identifies predictors that can be almost perfectly predicted by flexible parametric additive models performed on the companion covariates. As this analysis can only be conducted with complete data for all variables, it will be done based on a flexible parametric additive model only involving the 5 above-mentioned pivotal covariates (complete cases) for the complete-cases set using the rms::redun function for each of 5 randomly selected imputed data sets (after multiple imputation has been conducted) using rms::redun 7. If interactions between covariates were prespecified to be included in the regression model, special attention should be given to evaluate the bivariate distribution of the interacting covariates. Appropriate graphical displays (see 6) should be used to visualise these distributions. No interactions are assumed to be considered. 15.3 Sources Data is available in this repository (subfolder data).

Including also kidney- and acute phase related variables will raise the proportion of missing values to about 36% which leads to a significant drop in power. A multiple imputation may then recover a lot of the information and may in particular be beneficial to keep the power of the (otherwise very complete) VIPs. 16.2 Missingness patterns over variables First we create a dendogram that shows which variables tend to be missing together: Furthermore, with variables missing in more than 10% of the cases, we create a heatmap that simultaneously shows the clusters of patients with missing values and the variables: In this heatmap, we see that CHOL and TRIG are always missing together (lowest hierarchy in dendogram), but there are no further such pairs among any other variables. There is also some evidence that when CHOL and TRIG are missing, also PAMY is missing, although this is not the case for a small proportion of patients. The big white space in the middle of the heatmap represents the approx. 30% of patients with no missing values in those variables. 16.3 Section session info ## R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 17763) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Austria.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Austria.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Austria.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Austria.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] DT_0.22 kableExtra_1.3.4 gt_0.4.0 naniar_0.6.1 ## [5] Hmisc_4.6-0 Formula_1.2-4 survival_3.2-13 lattice_0.20-45 ## [9] forcats_0.5.1 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.8 purrr_0.3.4 ## [13] readr_2.1.2 tidyr_1.2.0 tibble_3.1.6 ggplot2_3.3.5 ## [17] tidyverse_1.3.1 here_1.0.1 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] fs_1.5.2 lubridate_1.8.0 webshot_0.5.2 ## [4] RColorBrewer_1.1-2 httr_1.4.2 rprojroot_2.0.2 ## [7] tools_4.1.3 backports_1.4.1 bslib_0.3.1 ## [10] utf8_1.2.2 R6_2.5.1 rpart_4.1.16 ## [13] DBI_1.1.2 colorspace_2.0-3 nnet_7.3-17 ## [16] withr_2.5.0 tidyselect_1.1.2 gridExtra_2.3 ## [19] compiler_4.1.3 cli_3.2.0 rvest_1.0.2 ## [22] htmlTable_2.4.0 xml2_1.3.3 bookdown_0.25 ## [25] sass_0.4.1 scales_1.1.1 checkmate_2.0.0 ## [28] commonmark_1.8.0 systemfonts_1.0.4 digest_0.6.29 ## [31] foreign_0.8-82 svglite_2.1.0 rmarkdown_2.13 ## [34] base64enc_0.1-3 jpeg_0.1-9 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ## [37] htmltools_0.5.2 highr_0.9 dbplyr_2.1.1 ## [40] fastmap_1.1.0 htmlwidgets_1.5.4 rlang_1.0.2 ## [43] readxl_1.3.1 rstudioapi_0.13 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [46] generics_0.1.2 jsonlite_1.8.0 magrittr_2.0.2 ## [49] Matrix_1.4-0 Rcpp_1.0.8.3 munsell_0.5.0 ## [52] fansi_1.0.3 lifecycle_1.0.1 visdat_0.5.3 ## [55] stringi_1.7.6 yaml_2.3.5 grid_4.1.3 ## [58] crayon_1.5.1 haven_2.4.3 splines_4.1.3 ## [61] hms_1.1.1 knitr_1.38 pillar_1.7.0 ## [64] reprex_2.0.1 glue_1.6.2 evaluate_0.15 ## [67] latticeExtra_0.6-29 data.table_1.14.2 modelr_0.1.8 ## [70] png_0.1-7 vctrs_0.3.8 tzdb_0.2.0 ## [73] cellranger_1.1.0 gtable_0.3.0 assertthat_0.2.1 ## [76] xfun_0.30 broom_0.7.12 viridisLite_0.4.0 ## [79] cluster_2.1.2 ellipsis_0.3.2 "],["univariate-distribution-checks-2.html", "Chapter 17 Univariate distribution checks 17.1 Data set overview 17.2 Categorical variables 17.3 Continuous variables 17.4 Section session info", " Chapter 17 Univariate distribution checks This section reports a series of univariate summary checks of the bacteremia dataset. 17.1 Data set overview Using the Hmisc describe function, we provide an overview of the data set.

We employ a function ida_trans for this purpose, which optimises the parameter sigma of the pseudo-logarithm for that purpose. The optimization targets the best possible linear correlation of the transformed values with normal deviates. If no better transformation can be found, no transformation is suggested. variables&lt;- c(&quot;Alter&quot;, pivotal_vars, vip_vars, leuko_related_vars, leuko_ratio_vars, kidney_related_vars, acute_related_vars, remaining_vars) unique.variables &lt;- unique(variables) #variables&lt;- c(&quot;Alter&quot;, pivotal_vars, vip_vars) res&lt;-sapply(unique.variables, function(X) ida_trans(b_bact[,X])$const) #takes long, calculate once, and save? res ## Alter WBC BUN KREA NEU PLT EOS ## NA 2.51471408 0.03198339 0.03193846 2.30783002 NA 0.11873740 ## BASO LYM MONO NEUR EOSR BASOR LYMR ## 0.12980073 0.17957981 0.26505156 NA 0.42874860 0.17300902 1.77333947 ## MONOR K eGFR BUN_KREA FIB CRP ASAT ## 3.00040692 0.02677349 NA 0.03194543 NA NA 0.03185536 ## ALAT GGT MCV HGB HCT MCH MCHC ## 1.02570312 0.03185702 NA NA NA NA NA ## RDW MPV NT APTT NA.

We investigate this further by looking only at leukocyte-related variables. 18.2.2 Redundancy among leukocyte-related variables In redundancy analysis of all predictor variables, the large number of non-complete cases is an issue. First we start with the leukocyte ratios - there should be large redundancy issues. This is even the case if no nonlinear modeling is applied.

(This also becomes clear from the histogram of NEUR, which shows the ratios of NEU to WBC.) When including both covariates in a model, it may happen that standard errors are inflated such that an association cannot be statistically proven; nevertheless, according to the preceding studies both variables could be important! One way to circumvent the problem is to generate a complementary variable that is defined as the difference of WBC and NEU and use this variable instead of WBC.
