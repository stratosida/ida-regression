["rectal-cancer-surgery-dataset.html", "Chapter 2 Rectal cancer surgery dataset", " Chapter 2 Rectal cancer surgery dataset Description: The data sets includes 345 patients undergoing minimally invasive resection for rectal cancer from 2005 to 2011. The 44 variables describe patient characteristics (age, bmi, current smoker, ASA, prior abdominal surgery), surgical and treatment variables (primary procedure, preop chemo, preop radiation), post-surgical complications (ileus, wound infection, death30, readmission30, ), and comorbidities (COPD, diabetes), and time to complications and time to follow-up. Complications include post-operative ileus, abscess, leak, wound infection, small bowel obstruction, reoperation for bleeding, and renal failure. Hypothetical research aim for IDA: Describe risk factors associated with the outcome ‘any complication’ developing within 30 days post surgery. Statistical analysis plan: Outcome: All-cause complications within 30 days post surgery defined as binary variable. Statistical methods: Logistic regression will be used to model all-cause complications by the following independent variables: age, sex, bmi, ASA, prior abdominal surgery, minimal invasive surgery, preop chemo, preop radiation, primary procedure, diabetes, copd, current smoker. Categorical variables with more than two levels will enter the analyses as several dummy variables. The reference category for those variables will be chosen according to the most frequent group. For continuous variables, a linear or quadratic relationship with log odds of complications will be assumed. Results will be described by a table containing odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals for each variable. For nonlinearly modelled continuous variables, the log odds ratio as a function of the continuous variable will be graphically displayed, along with corresponding pointwise 95% confidence intervals. Moreover, odds ratios for comparisons between 90th, 75th, 25th and 10th percentile compared to median will be presented. A calibration plot comparing the agreement of predicted probabilities for the event and observed event rates will be constructed to check internal validity of the model. Overall model fit will be described by the area under the ROC curve and the explained variation (EV) based on the squared correlation of the predicted probabilities and the binary outcome variable. Partial explained variation (drop in EV after omitting a variable) will be computed for each variable to assess relative importance.

["crash-2-prediction-model.html", "Chapter 3 CRASH-2 prediction model 3.1 Statistical analysis plan", " Chapter 3 CRASH-2 prediction model Description: Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolyticin Significant Haemorrhage(CRASH-2) was a large randomised placebo controlled trial among trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant haemorrhage, of the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment on death and transfusion requirement. The study is described at the original trial website. A public version of the data set is found at a repository of public data sets hosted by the Vanderbilt University’s Department of Biostatistics (Prof. Frank Harrell Jr.). The data set includes 20,207 patients and 44 variables. Hypothetical research aim for IDA: Develop a multivariable model for early death (death within 28 days from injury) using 9 independent variables of mixed type (continuous, categorical, semicontinuous) with the primary aim of prediction and a secondary aim of describing the association of each variable with the outcome. The assumed analysis aim is in line with the prediction model presented by Perel et al, BMJ 2012, supplement available at. However, in contrast to the analysis described there, variables describing the economic region and the treatment allocation are missing in the public version of the data set, and while the data set contains 20,207 patients, the research paper mentions 20,127 patients having been included in the study. 3.1 Statistical analysis plan Outcome: Early death, i.e. in-hospital death within 28 days from injury (binary variable) Statistical methods: Logistic regression will be used to model early death by the following independent variables deemed important to predict early death: Age (age, years) Sex (sex, male or female) Systolic blood pressure (sbp, mmHg) Heart rate (hr, 1/min) Respiratory rate (rr, 1/min) Glasgow coma score (gcs, points) Central capillary refill time (cc, seconds) Time since injury (injurytime, hours) Type of injury (injurytype, ‘blunt’, ‘penetrating’ or ‘blunt and penetrating’) Restricted cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom with knots set to default values will be used for continuous variables. As the final prediction model should be parsimonious enough to simplify its application, a backward elimination algorithm with a significance level set at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) will be applied to remove statistically insignificant effects. Finally, nonlinear representation of each continuous variable will be tested against linear representation at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). In case of lacking added value of a nonlinear effect, the model will be refitted with a linear effect for that variable. Remarks: Regarding type of injury, the original paper describes its treatment in the model as follows: ‘Type of injury had three categories—-penetrating, blunt, or blunt and penetrating—but we analysed it as ’penetrating’ or ‘blunt and penetrating.’ ’ It is not clear from that description what happened to the ‘blunt’ group. (I assume they were collapsed with ‘blunt and penetrating’.) The original paper describes the modeling approach as follows: ‘We used a backward stepwise approach. Firstly, we included all potential prognostic factors and interaction terms that users considered plausible. These interactions included all potential predictors with type of injury, time since injury, and age. We then removed, one at a time, terms for which we found no strong evidence of an association, judged according to the P values (&lt;0.05) from the Wald test.’ This would mean they tested at least 24 interaction terms, each possibly using several degrees of freedom! In the final model, only an interaction of Glasgow coma score and type of injury was included. Preparations: The outcome variable, early death (i.e., death within 28 days from injury) must be computed from the time span between date of death and date of randomisation using the following code: # transform ddeath and trandomisation into an interpretable date format and then compute the difference # interpret NAs as &#39;not died within study period, at least not within 28 days&#39; # if patients died after 28 days, treat as alive #crash2$time2death &lt;- as.numeric(as.Date(crash2$ddeath) - as.Date(crash2$trandomised)) #crash2$earlydeath[!is.na(crash2$time2death)] &lt;- (crash2$time2death[!is.na(crash2$time2death)] &lt;= 28) + 0 # +0 to transform it from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0 #crash2$earlydeath[is.na(crash2$time2death)] &lt;- 0 # NA in time2death means alive at day 28 #table(crash2$earlydeath) The number of deaths computed in the data set coincides with the number reported in Perel et al, BMJ 2012.
