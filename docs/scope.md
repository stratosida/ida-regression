# Scope of the regression analyses for the examples

Regression models can be used for a wide range of purposes, for the purpose of these examples the assumptions on the regression analysis set-up in this paper are listed in Table 1. Thus, IDA tasks will be explained in a well-defined, practically relevant setting. Since a key principle is that IDA does not touch the research question no associations between dependent (outcome)  and independent (non-outcome) variables are considered.

*Table 1:* The scope of the regression analyses considered for IDA tasks

|Aspects of the research plan|Assumptions in this paper|Reason for the assumption|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|Dependent (outcome) variable|One dependent variable that can be continuous or binary; exclude time-to-event or longitudinal outcomes|Explain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting|
|Regression models|Models with linear predictors|Explain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting|
|Purpose of regression model|Adjust effect of one variable of interest for confounders; quantify the effects of explanatory variables on the outcome|Explain IDA tasks in a well-defined, practically relevant setting|
|Independent variables|“explanatory” or “confounder” depending on purpose of model; small to moderate number of mixed types; Not high dimensional; no repeated measurements|To demonstrate IDA approaches for a mix of variables likely to be encountered in practice|
|Statistical analysis plan|Exists, defines the outcome variable, the type of regression model to be used, and a set of independent variables|IDA does not touch the research question, but may lead to an update or refinement of the analysis plan|
