,,,Help in interpreting results,Update SAP,Update intended presentation of results,CRASH-2,Bacteremia,NHANES
Univariate distributions,Continuous variables,General skewness,Wide CI for coefficients,Use variable as log-transformed,,,,
,,Outliers,Disproportional impact on results,Winsorize or transform,Model involves winsorization,,,
,,Spike at 0,Narrow CI at 0,Use appropriate representation of variable in model,Use 2 (or more) coefficents to distinguish 0 from non-0 continuous part,,,
,Categorical variables,Frequencies,Comparisons to default reference probably irrelevant,Change reference category,Contrasts compare to (new) reference category,,,
,,Rare categories,Wide CI for coefficients,Collapse/exclude,Fewer categories to present,,,
,,One very frequent category,Comparisons irrelevant?,Exclude variable,Variable omitted,,,
Bivariate distributions,Continuous by continuous,Outliers (from the cloud),Disproportional impact on results,Winsorize or transform,Model involves winsorization,,,
,,Correlations,Wide CI for coefficients,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Continuous by categorical,Outliers (only visible in bivariate plot),,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Categorical by categorical,Frequent/rare combinations,Comparison to default reference irrelevant,Change reference category,Contrasts compare to (new) reference category,,,
,,,interactions relevant?,Remove interaction from model,Fewer interactions to present,,,
Missing values,Per variable,Number and proportion,Wide CI for coefficients,Remove variable if many missing values,,,,
,Pattern,Variables missing independently or together,,Omit variables together,Changes model,,,
,Pattern,Variables missing dependent on levels of other variables,Systematic missingness? Model still based on representative?, IPW needed?,Weighted analysis,,,
,Complete cases,Number and proportion,Few cases left for main CCO analysis,Multiple imputation (or other way of dealing with missing values)?,Result from MI analysis? Or applicability restricted to a subpopulation?,,,
