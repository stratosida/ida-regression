# Overview {-}

The focus of this document/website is to provide guidance on conducting initial data analysis in a reproducible manner in the context of intended regression analyses.

We present the work flow of IDA through a series of case studies: 

* CRASH-2
* National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

```{r include = FALSE}
## For reproducibility 
#library(checkpoint)

## Point to a specific point in time in MRAN
## This will install the same packages if they are not installed
#checkpoint("2020-07-01") 

## load packages
library(here)

## Load source function
source(here::here("R", "ida_plot_univar.R"))
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
